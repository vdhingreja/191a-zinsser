# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Vinayak Dhingreja

The second chapter talks about simplicity. The writer must think clearly to write clearly. If the audience has to read more words than necessary they will lose attention to the words and read something else. He says that you must constantly make sure that what you are writing is what you are trying to say. The third chapter is about clutter. He says to remove the extra words that are in your sentences as fillers. Use short words when possible. Avoid redundancies in your sentences and get to the point.
